REIT Data Market provides novel data science and geo-spatial analytics for REIT data & investing. Our pure data science and geo-spatial approach provides a fresh, alternative perspective of risks and exposure for REIT investors used to analysis which relies entirely on NOI, NAV, FFO, and other performance outputs. We offer marketplace listings on Snowflake with data analytics detailing geographic concentration risks at multiple levels of political geography (Metro, County, Zipcode) and urban geography (Urban, Suburban and Rural), demographic profiles for each REIT across space and time and custom REIT geo-thematic indicies produced using geo-spatial data science techniques. These geospatial metrics reflect performance inputs. They have produced a proven track record to drive passive investing/trading strategies that outperform the major market capitalization weighted indices.","Financial, Geospatial",REIT Geospatial Analytics,,,Subscription Service,North America,Both - most common,"Free, Subscription","API, CSV",Service Provider,financial,"data:image/png;base64,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",,Sam
